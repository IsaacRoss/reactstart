# Fun With React 

this is a simple startup configuration like the one I was using yesterday. 

the webpack config, while small and simple will 
 * live reload server
 * automatically compile jsx
 * allow you to write es6
 * allow you to separate modules into files and require them, like this:
 


```javascript
var card = require('./card');
```

To run this app:
install webpack globally
```
npm install -g webpack
```

Then just run 
```
npm install
npm start
```
